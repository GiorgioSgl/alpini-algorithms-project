# alpini-algorithms-project

Group project assinged during the Algorithms and Data Structures course in 2018.

The assingment document (in Italian) is available in the repo.

Basically an instance of the Undirected Feedback Vertex Set problem, known to be NP-Complete. We tried to solve it using the backtrack strategy with a few modifications, with good results.
